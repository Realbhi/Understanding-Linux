### The Purpose and Significance of Operating Systems


Before delving into Linux specifics, it is vital to grasp the fundamental role of an operating system. An OS acts as an intermediate software layer between hardware and the user or software applications. The physical components of a computer—CPU, memory, storage, motherboard, and network interfaces—cannot be accessed directly by users or most software. Instead, the OS manages process management, memory management, device management, and network management.
Users and applications require an interface to communicate with hardware resources.
Users interact via Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Command Line Interface (CLI) provided by the OS.
Applications rely on the OS to allocate hardware resources without directly managing them.
The OS is the “heart” of the computer, enabling efficient and secure operation.
This foundational understanding sets the stage for appreciating Linux as a specialized OS.
