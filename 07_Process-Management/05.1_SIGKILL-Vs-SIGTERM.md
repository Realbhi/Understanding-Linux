### “Default action” ≠ “force kill”

---

## First: what “default action” means (very literally)

For **every signal**, the kernel has a **predefined rule** called its *default action*.

Examples:

| Signal  | Default action        |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| SIGTERM | **Terminate process** |
| SIGINT  | **Terminate process** |
| SIGSEGV | Terminate + core dump |
| SIGKILL | **Kill immediately**  |

So when we say **“default action”**, we mean:

> *What the kernel does **if the process did not install a handler***.

Nothing more.

---

## Now: what “force kill” really means

A **force kill** means:

* No handler can run
* Process cannot refuse
* Process cannot delay
* Kernel stops execution **immediately**

Only **SIGKILL (9)** does this.

```bash
kill -9 PID
```

This is *true force*.

---

## The confusion point (this is the key)

### SIGTERM default action = “terminate”

But that **does NOT mean force kill**.

Why?

Because **SIGTERM can be handled**.

So there are **two paths**:

---

## Path 1: SIGTERM **with handler**

```bash
kill PID
```

1. Kernel delivers SIGTERM
2. Process handler runs
3. Process decides:

   * exit now
   * exit later
   * never exit

➡ Kernel does **nothing else**

✔ Not forced
✔ Process controls its fate

---

## Path 2: SIGTERM **without handler**

```bash
kill PID
```

1. Kernel delivers SIGTERM
2. No handler exists
3. Kernel applies default action
4. Kernel **terminates process**

Important:

* Kernel **stops user code**
* Kernel **cleans up resources**
* Parent gets exit status

But:

❌ No application cleanup
❌ No graceful logic
❌ No choice by process

Still — **this is not SIGKILL**

---

## Why this is NOT called “force kill”

Because the **signal itself** was *polite*.

The kernel only terminated the process because:

> “The process didn’t say otherwise.”

If the process *had* a handler, it could have survived.

---

## Compare with SIGKILL (this is the contrast)

```bash
kill -9 PID
```

1. Kernel receives SIGKILL
2. Kernel **does not check handlers**
3. Kernel **immediately stops process**
4. No cleanup, no choice, no delay

➡ This is **forced**

---

## One sentence that fixes everything

> **SIGTERM kills by default, but SIGKILL kills unconditionally.**

That’s it.

---

## Visual mental model

```
SIGTERM:
  ├── handler exists → process decides
  └── no handler → kernel terminates

SIGKILL:
  └── kernel terminates immediately (always)
```

---

## Final corrected understanding 

> “Default action means what the kernel does *only if the process does nothing*.
> Force kill means the process is not allowed to do anything at all.”
